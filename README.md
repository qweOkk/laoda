# laoda
#If you want to run java program through main.java, I suggest you to use Idea which I used to run it with JDK8, or you can use maven to download what I put in pom.xml and use javafx:run to run it.
#If you want to run laoda.exe only, you can download everything in /target and decompress the jdk, you put the jdk and laoda.exe in the same path, you can run it.
